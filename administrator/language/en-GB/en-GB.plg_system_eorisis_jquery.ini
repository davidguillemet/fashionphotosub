;	jQuery Library
;	--------------
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_CHOICE="Version to use:"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_CHOICE_DESC="Always check your website when upgrading to a new version of the jQuery library. It is recommended to always reference a Specific version of the jQuery library on a live website, unless you are during development or experimenting. Most important reason to avoid using the automatic Always Latest option is that an unexpected code change to a new version of jQuery library may cause compatibility issues to your current working scripts and cause them to stop working. Also, non specific version urls pointing to a library on a CDN, usually (if not always) do not have a far-future Expires Header and as a result they will not be cached by the web browser, causing poor performance."
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_SPECIFIC="Specific (Recommended)"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_CUSTOM="Custom"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_LATEST="Always Latest"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_SOURCE_LATEST="Source for 'Always Latest':"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_SOURCE_LATEST_DESC="You can get the latest version of the jQuery library automatically from the CDN of your choice. You need to select 'Always Latest' from the 'Version to use' option."
EO_JQ_JQUERY_SOURCE_SPECIFIC="Source for Specific:"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_DESC="If you have selected 'Specific' from the 'Version to use' options, here you can choose it's Source.<br><br>CDN stands for Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network. It is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet. Using CDN as a Source you increase website performance dramatically.<br><br>A copy of every 'Specific Version' of the jQuery library also exists in the 'media' directory of your website. So, choosing 'Locally Hosted' will load the library from the local path. Also see 'CDN Fallback'."
EO_JQ_JQUERY_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_CDN="CDN for Specific/Custom:"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_CDN_DESC="If you chose to use a 'Specific' or a 'Custom' version from the 'Version to use' options, here you can choose it's CDN. Choose the one you think is best for you. All CDN Sources listed do have SSL available. The plug-in uses Scheme Relative (protocol-less or protocol-relative) URLs for all CDN sources.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Google's domain is banned in some countries."
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION="Specific Version:"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_DESC="Recommended Series: 1.x.<br>Current Default Version: 1.11.1<br><br>jQuery 2.x has the same API as jQuery 1.x, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8.<br><br>To troubleshoot cases where old scripts are used on your website and you see unexpected results, lowering the jQuery version is a good practice although it is recommended to update your scripts and use an up-to-date jQuery version. If you use a CDN Source, always make sure that the Source does have the version you chose to use (especially if the version you chose is too new or too old)."
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_CUSTOM_LABEL="Custom Version:"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_CUSTOM_TYPE="Custom Version Type:"
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_CUSTOM_TYPE_DESC="Although the plugin is focused in using the minified type for live website performance, here you can also choose uncompressed. This is mainly for development purposes and is not recommended on a live website."
EO_JQ_JQUERY_VERSION_CUSTOM_DESC="This field will only be used if you are using a CDN Source and the 'Version to Use' is set to 'Custom'.<br><br>If the version for the jQuery library you want to use does not exist in the 'Specific Version' list, then you may set it in this field and choose a CDN Source to load it from.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Having 'CDN Fallback' enabled, in case the version you set here does not exist on that source, then the 'Specific Version' will be used as a fallback. The field accepts only version characters. Example: 1.4.4rc2"

;	-------
;	Migrate
;	-------
EO_JQ_STATE="State:"
EO_JQ_MIGRATE_DESC="If you choose 'Auto Load' Migrate will load when using jQuery library 1.9.0 or higher. Migrate is only required for jQuery 1.9.0 or higher to restore deprecated and removed functionality."

In reality browsers seem to apply 'all' if the attribute is omitted."
EO_JQ_UI_THEME="Theme (CSS):"
EO_JQ_UI_THEME_DESC="Theme Images will get loaded only when using CDN as source or when using 'Use Custom UI Files'."
EO_JQ_UI_VERSION_DESC="jQuery UI 1.11.x and 1.10.x series need jQuery library 1.6+<br>If you need to use an older version of jQuery UI that is not available in the plugin, enable the 'Use Custom UI Files' option."

EO_JQ_LOCAL_URLS_DESC="This setting controls the local urls to all files (e.g.. js, css) generated and/or controlled by this plug-in.<br><br><b>Absolute</b> URLs contain the Scheme (http or https), the Host or Fully Qualified Domain Name (www.example.com) and the rest of the path if available (/path/to/file.js).<br>Example: http://www.example.com/path/to/file.js<br><br><b>Scheme Relative</b> are Absolute URLs without the Scheme, so that they always follow the page's Scheme respectively and avoid various conflicts such as when an http url is requested from an https page.<br>Example: //www.example.com/path/to/file.js<br><br><b>Relative</b> URLs contain only the path, without the Scheme and Host/Domain (FQDN).<br>Example: /path/to/file.js<br><br><b>Notes:</b> Joomla is developed to use relative URLs. If you choose 'Scheme Relative' and you use some extension to optimize/combine JavaScript files, that does not understand Scheme Relative URLs, your page's output might break. Search engine spiders do not like 'Relative' URLs."

EO_JQ_ABSOLUTE="Absolute"
EO_JQ_RELATIVE="Relative"
EO_JQ_SCHEME="Scheme:"

This means that in the case you are able to access e.g., example.com from www.example.com (or any other subdomain), then the current Domain (FQDN) will be the one you access it from. For users that prefer Scheme Relative or Absolute Local URLs and need to force the plug-in to use a specific Domain (FQDN) that will not change, then the 'Custom' option should be used.<br><br>If you have set the $live_site variable in your configuration.php file, then you should not worry and choose Auto here, although on websites that use both http and https on different pages the $live_site causes trouble and is not recommended."
EO_JQ_FQDN_CUSTOM="Custom Domain (FQDN):"
EO_JQ_FQDN_CUSTOM_DESC="Accepted format should be without scheme (http or https), without :// and without the relative path.<br><br><b>Correct Entry Examples:</b><br>example.com<br>www.example.com<br>other.subdomain.example.com<br><br><b>Wrong Entry Examples:</b><br>http://example.com<br>http://www.example.com/joomla/<br>http://example.com/index.php<br>www.example.com/joomla"

EO_JQ_LOAD_AREA_DESC="Anything you load through this plugin depends on the jQuery Library (jQuery UI, Chosen or Easing), so when you choose to load any of them to an area, then the jQuery library must be loaded respectively to the same area. For example, if you set jQuery UI on 'Site And Administrator' then set the jQuery library on 'Site And Administrator' as well.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Joomla 3 loads the jQuery library in both Site and Administrator by default. Joomla 2.5 does not load any jQuery library. If you use additional Joomla JavaScript plug-ins other than eorisis jQuery, pay attention to the way you sort them in the Joomla > Plug-ins section."

Also, if you have enabled the 'System - Cache' plug-in in Joomla, then this feature cannot work properly. This option may slow down the page load, always depending on network."
